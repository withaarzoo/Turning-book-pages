                        <p class="page__content-blockquote-text">HARI SELDON — . . . born in the 11,988th year of the
                            Galactic Era; died 12,069. The dates are more commonly given in terms of the current
                            Foundational Era as -79 to the year 1 F.E. Born to middle-class parents on Helicon, Arcturus
                            sector (where his father, in a legend of doubtful authenticity, was a tobacco grower in the
                            hydroponic plants of the planet), he early showed amazing ability in mathematics. Anecdotes
                            concerning his ability are innumerable, and some are contradictory. At the age of two, he is
                            said to have. . . </p>
                        <p class="page__content-blockquote-text">. . . Undoubtedly his greatest contributions were in
                            the field of psychohistory. Seldon found the field little more than a set of vague axioms;
                            he left it a profound statistical science. . . . </p>
                        <p class="page__content-blockquote-text">. . . The best existing authority we have for the
                            details of his life is the biography written by Gaal Dornick who, as a young man, met Seldon
                            two years before the great mathematician's death. The story of the meeting . . .</p>

                        <p>His name was Gaal Dornick and he was just a country boy who had never seen Trantor before.
                            That is, not in real life. He had seen it many times on the hyper-video, and occasionally in
                            tremendous three-dimensional newscasts covering an Imperial Coronation or the opening of a
                            Galactic Council. Even though he had lived all his life on the world of Synnax, which
                            circled a star at the edges of the Blue Drift, he was not cut off from civilization, you
                            see. At that time, no place in the Galaxy was. </p>

                        <p>There were nearly twenty-five million inhabited planets in the Galaxy then, and not one but
                            owed allegiance to the Empire whose seat was on Trantor. It was the last half-century in
                            which that could be said. </p>
